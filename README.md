## How the Game Works

In this game you have a player (princess girl) and enemies (bugs). The goal of the player is to reach the water, without colliding into any one of the enemies.

* The player can move left, right, up and down
* The enemies move at varying speeds on the paved block portion of the game board
* Once a the player collides with an enemy, the game is reset and the player moves back to the starting square
* Once the player reaches the water, the game is won
